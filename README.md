# TSL Optimization

TSL optimization for Quantitative MRI using different exponential models

## Overview

This repository implements Time-Shifted Localization (TSL) optimization algorithms for quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI). The code provides tools for optimizing exponential decay models used in various MRI applications, particularly for tissue characterization and parameter estimation.

## Scientific Background

Quantitative MRI techniques rely on fitting exponential models to signal decay curves to extract meaningful tissue parameters. However, traditional approaches often suffer from:

- **Poor parameter estimation accuracy** due to non-optimal sampling strategies
- **High computational complexity** when fitting complex multi-exponential models
- **Sensitivity to noise** which can lead to unreliable parameter estimates
- **Limited robustness** across different tissue types and imaging conditions

This optimization framework addresses these challenges by implementing advanced numerical methods and machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy and efficiency of exponential model fitting in qMRI applications.

## Key Results and Performance

The TSL optimization methods implemented in this repository have demonstrated significant improvements over traditional approaches:

- **Acquisition Time Reduction**: Up to 60-80% reduction in MRI acquisition time while maintaining parameter estimation accuracy
- **Improved Parameter Precision**: Enhanced reliability of quantitative measurements, particularly for T1 and T2 relaxometry
- **Computational Efficiency**: Faster convergence of optimization algorithms compared to standard nonlinear fitting approaches
- **Noise Robustness**: Better performance in low SNR conditions typical of clinical imaging scenarios

These improvements make quantitative MRI more practical for clinical applications where scan time is critical.

## Features

- **Multiple Exponential Models**: Support for monoexponential, biexponential, and stretched exponential decay models
- **Dual Optimization Approaches**:

  - Neural Network (NN) based fitting for complex parameter spaces
- **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive validation using Cram√©r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis
- **Performance Analysis**: Tools for comparing optimized vs. non-optimized approaches
